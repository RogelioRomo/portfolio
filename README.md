# Rogelio's Portfolio

This is my personal web portfolio. In this I show all the projects and experience I have in software and web development. It is also a nice way to present myself to others in a more user friendly enviroment.




## ðŸ”— Links
This site has two different versions, in other words two different designs. I switch designs depending of what I feel to show. Go ahead and click the shield bellow to be redirected to the site and find out what design did you get!

## Tech used

The site is just a front-end project, and I kept it as simple as possible. It's build with:
- Vite and ReactJS
- Tailwind for styling
- Iconify react npm packages for the icons
